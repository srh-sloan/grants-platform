# Grants Platform — AI Context

Longer-form notes for Claude / any AI pair working on this repo. The `README.md`
is the source of truth for what the team has actually agreed; this file is
reference material and working context. `PLAN.md` holds the feature
catalogue, phase ordering, and parallel-stream breakdown — consult it before
picking up work so you don't duplicate another stream or jump phases.

## Read this first (operating mode)

This is a **one-day, four-person hackathon** building an **iterative, modular,
innovative MVP**. Your job as AI pair is to produce code and docs that look
like they were written by one team, not five individuals on different days.
That means following the patterns in this file even when a different approach
would be locally simpler.

**Also read `CONTRIBUTING.md` before starting any task.** It contains the
team's agreed hackathon requirements — working accessible interface, GOV.UK
styling (no crown), dependency upgrade blueprint, AI tool usage, and domain
knowledge standards. These apply to every piece of work, not just the streams
that explicitly own those concerns.

Before acting on any task:

1. **Locate the task in `PLAN.md`.** Which phase? Which stream? If you can't
   place it, ask — don't guess. Don't start phase N+1 work while phase N is
   unfinished.
2. **Pick the thinnest slice that demos.** If the prompt implies a full
   feature, propose a thin slice first and confirm. "One page, one field, one
   grant, happy path" beats half-built breadth.
3. **Prefer config over code.** If the change would hardcode grant-specific
   behaviour (EHCF weights, EHCF eligibility, EHCF field labels) into Python
   or templates, stop. It belongs in `grants.config_json` or
   `forms.schema_json`.
4. **Respect stream boundaries.** Each stream owns a set of files (see
   `PLAN.md` → Parallelisation summary). If a task needs a file outside your
   stream, prefer adding to a contract (e.g. a model column, a helper
   function) over reaching across and restructuring someone else's code.
5. **Leave `main` runnable.** Every commit should boot the app and pass
   `pytest`. If a change can't land atomically, land a stub first.
6. **Meet the hackathon requirements in `CONTRIBUTING.md`.** Before marking
   any task done, check the four requirements: interface quality, dep hygiene,
   AI tool use, and domain knowledge. If a slice touches UI, verify GOV.UK
   macros are used and the crown is absent. If it calls an AI, confirm the
   prompt reads from config.

## Project Overview

**GrantOS** is a reusable internal government grants platform with five
connected surfaces: **grant builder**, **applicant workspace**, **assessor
workbench**, **monitoring/KPI generator**, and **portfolio dashboard**. First
grant onboarded: the **Ending Homelessness in Communities Fund (EHCF)**,
administered by MHCLG.
Two user types:

- **Applicants** — voluntary, community, and faith sector (VCFS) organisations
  applying for grant funding.
- **Assessors** — department staff reviewing, scoring, and making funding
  decisions.

The system should handle additional grants in future (see
`refs/pride-in-place-prospectus.md` as a second shape to stress-test against),
so **grant-specific things — eligibility rules, form fields, scoring criteria,
weights — live in data (JSON), not code.**

## Current direction (v0)

See `README.md`. Short version: Flask + SQLite, JSON-defined forms, session
auth, iterative thin slices. We are four people on a hackathon, so we optimise
for shipping working slices over completeness.

## Tech Stack

| Layer | Choice | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Language | Python 3.12+ (pinned via `.python-version`) | Managed with `uv` |
| Web framework | Flask 3 | Jinja2 for templates |
| Database | SQLite | Single file, zero-config. Postgres later if we outgrow it. |
| ORM | SQLAlchemy 2.0 via Flask-SQLAlchemy | Locked in — `app.extensions.db`. |
| Migrations | Alembic | Deferred until the schema settles; `seed.py --reset` does the destructive reset in the meantime. |
| Auth | Flask-Login + `werkzeug.security` | Session-based |
| Forms | **JSON schemas for applicant forms; WTForms (via Flask-WTF) for static forms (login, scoring) and CSRF** | Form *definitions* are JSON files; the app is a generic runner over them |
| Styling | GOV.UK Frontend | `govuk-frontend-jinja` macros + `govuk-frontend-wtf` widgets, vendored CSS/JS in `app/static/` |
| File uploads | Local filesystem for v0 | S3 only if we need it |
| Deployment | Docker + docker-compose with gunicorn (prod profile) and Flask dev server (dev profile) | See `Dockerfile`, `docker-compose.yml`, README "Quick start". |

Nothing here is locked in — if someone spots a simpler option mid-hackathon,
flag it.

## Data Model (flexible core)

The model is deliberately grant-agnostic. Grant-specific things hang off JSON
blobs keyed by a form schema.

### `users`
- `id`, `email`, `password_hash`, `role` (`applicant` | `assessor` | `admin`)
- `org_id` (nullable — only set for applicants)

### `organisations`
- `id`, `name`, `contact_name`, `contact_email`
- `profile_json` — org type, charity number, income, address, etc. Shape comes
  from a profile form schema, not hardcoded columns.

### `grants`
- `id`, `slug` (e.g. `ehcf`), `name`, `status` (`open` | `closed`)
- `config_json` — eligibility rules, scoring criteria and weights, award
  ranges, deadlines. Everything grant-specific lives here.

### `forms`
- `id`, `grant_id`, `kind` (`application` | `assessment` | `eligibility`)
- `version`, `schema_json` — the JSON form definition

### `applications`
- `id`, `org_id`, `grant_id`, `form_version`
- `status` (`draft` | `submitted` | `under_review` | `approved` | `rejected`)
- `answers_json` — applicant's answers, keyed to the form schema
- `submitted_at`

### `documents`
- `id`, `application_id`, `kind` (e.g. `budget`, `la_letter`), `storage_path`,
  `filename`, `uploaded_at`

### `assessments`
- `id`, `application_id`, `assessor_id`
- `scores_json` — `{criterion_id: 0..3}`, criterion IDs come from the grant config
- `notes_json` — per-criterion justifications
- `weighted_total`, `recommendation` (`fund` | `reject` | `refer`)
- `completed_at`

Columns may evolve — treat this as a starting point, not a spec.

### Additional model concepts (from product vision)

These extend the core model for the monitoring, AI, and portfolio surfaces.
They are additive — they do not change any existing tables.

### `kpi_templates`
- `id`, `grant_id` (nullable — some KPIs are reusable across grants)
- `indicator_name`, `definition`, `evidence_type`, `reporting_frequency`
- `owner` (which role reports on it)
- Used by the monitoring plan generator to produce grant- and application-specific packs.

### `monitoring_plans`
- `id`, `application_id`
- `kpis_json` — generated list of KPI lines, targets, baselines, cadence
- `milestones_json` — milestone checkpoints with dates
- `generated_at`, `confirmed_by` (nullable — human must review)

### `knowledge_packs`
- `id`, `grant_id`
- `content_json` — prospectus/guidance/FAQ chunks, structured for retrieval
- Used by AI features to ground pre-fill and scoring in the published rubric.

---

## Scoring (data-driven)

Criteria, weights, and auto-reject rules come from the grant's `config_json`,
not from hardcoded constants. Rough shape:

```python
# scoring.py
def calculate_weighted_score(scores: dict, criteria: list[dict]) -> int:
    return sum(scores[c["id"]] * c["weight"] for c in criteria)

def has_auto_reject(scores: dict, criteria: list[dict]) -> bool:
    return any(
        scores[c["id"]] == 0
        for c in criteria
        if c.get("auto_reject_on_zero")
    )
```

A grant config snippet looks like:

```json
{
  "criteria": [
    {"id": "skills",    "label": "Skills and experience", "weight": 10, "max": 3, "auto_reject_on_zero": true},
    {"id": "proposal2", "label": "Proposal (Part 2)",     "weight": 30, "max": 3, "auto_reject_on_zero": true}
  ]
}
```

---

## AI Features (provider wrapper pattern)

All AI features call a live model via the team's Anthropic/OpenAI API key
through a provider wrapper. The wrapper keeps prompts grant-agnostic —
every prompt reads from `grant.config_json`, not hardcoded EHCF references
— so the same AI layer works across all grants added via the Grant Builder.

AI is positioned as **triage and drafting support**, not autonomous
decision-making. Never frame AI as "auto-approval" or "automated award
decision". The right phrase is "AI-assisted rubric scoring and triage."

### `prefill_application(docs, schema) → {field_id: {value, source}}`

Input: uploaded documents + grant form schema.
Output: suggested field values with provenance.
Display: "Suggested answer generated from your annual report / project plan."
The user edits and confirms manually — never silently write into the final
application.

### `score_application(answers, rubric, docs) → [{criterion_id, score, confidence, evidence_found, evidence_missing, recommendation}]`

Input: application answers + rubric + uploaded docs.
Output per criterion: provisional score 0–3, confidence, evidence found,
evidence missing, recommendation for assessor.
Assessor reviews, edits, and confirms. If they change the score, store the
original and the override.

### `generate_monitoring_plan(application, template) → {kpis, milestones, cadence}`

Input: approved application + monitoring template from grant config.
Output: KPI list, reporting frequency, evidence types, milestone table.
Human must review before the plan is confirmed.

### `extract_grant_structure(prospectus_text) → draft_grant_config`

Stretch feature only. Upload prospectus text → draft grant definition.
Human must edit and approve before publish.

---

## Key User Flows

### Applicant
1. **Eligibility check** — rules from the grant config (see EHCF below).
2. **Register / sign in** — Flask-Login, password hashing.
3. **Multi-step application** — form runner renders pages from the JSON
   schema. Each page saves as draft.
4. **Upload supporting documents** — budget, project plan, LA support letter, risk register.
5. **AI pre-fill** — system suggests draft answers from uploaded documents with provenance; user edits and confirms.
6. **Review & submit** — read-only summary, task-list checklist, then submit (no withdrawal).
7. **Track status** — dashboard shows state transitions.

### Assessor
1. **Application list** — filters (status, LA area, funding type, score).
2. **Eligibility gate** — deterministic pass/fail from rules, shown as flags.
3. **Application detail** — applicant answers alongside the scoring form.
4. **AI-assisted triage** — per-criterion provisional scores, evidence snippets, 0-score risk flags, confidence levels, missing evidence detection.
5. **Score each criterion** — 0–3 with mandatory notes; override AI provisional score.
6. **Flag for moderation** — borderline or conflicted.
7. **Allocation dashboard** — ranked by weighted score, running total against
   the grant's budget.

### Grant Admin
1. **View grant definitions** — see EHCF config, criteria, eligibility rules.
2. **Clone and edit** — duplicate a grant to create a draft second grant.
3. **Preview and publish** — make a grant round visible to applicants.
4. **Assisted onboarding** (stretch) — upload prospectus → draft structure → human review → publish.

### Monitoring / Leadership
1. **Generate monitoring plan** — for an approved application, produce draft KPIs, milestones, cadence.
2. **Portfolio dashboard** — active funds, applications by stage, assessor workload.
3. **Director view** — application counts, ready-for-review, missing docs, 0-score risks, average turnaround.

## First grant: EHCF specifics

These should end up in the EHCF grant's `config_json`, not hardcoded.

**Eligibility**
- `org_type` ∈ {charity, CIO, CIC, community benefit society, PCC}
- `annual_income` ≤ £5,000,000
- `years_serving_homeless` ≥ 3
- `operates_in_england` = true
- LA endorsement letter required before submission
- Capital funding needs a year-1 readiness checklist (planning permission,
  tenure, contractor)

**Scoring weights** (out of 300)

| Criterion | Weight | Max raw | Weighted max |
|---|---|---|---|
| Skills and experience | 10% | 3 | 30 |
| Proposal Part 1 | 10% | 3 | 30 |
| Proposal Part 2 | 30% | 3 | 90 |
| Deliverability Part 1 | 25% | 3 | 75 |
| Deliverability Part 2 | 5% | 3 | 15 |
| Cost and value | 10% | 3 | 30 |
| Outcomes and impact | 10% | 3 | 30 |

Any criterion scoring 0 → auto-reject.

**Fund context**
- Total: £37m over 3 years (2026–2029)
- Per-award: £50k–£200k/year revenue; £50k–£200k capital (year 1 or 2 only)
- Contact: ehcf@communities.gov.uk
- Prospectus: https://www.gov.uk/guidance/ending-homelessness-in-communities-fund-prospectus

## GOV.UK Frontend Setup

### Flask app factory (`app/__init__.py`)
The factory wires `govuk-frontend-jinja` and `govuk-frontend-wtf` into the
Jinja loader so their macros resolve under their own prefixes, then initialises
`WTFormsHelpers` for GOV.UK-styled WTForms widgets:

```python
from jinja2 import ChoiceLoader, PackageLoader, PrefixLoader
from govuk_frontend_wtf.main import WTFormsHelpers

from app.extensions import csrf, db, login_manager

def create_app():
    app = Flask(__name__)
    # ... config.from_object ...

    app.jinja_loader = ChoiceLoader([
        PackageLoader("app"),
        PrefixLoader({
            "govuk_frontend_jinja": PackageLoader("govuk_frontend_jinja"),
            "govuk_frontend_wtf": PackageLoader("govuk_frontend_wtf"),
        }),
    ])
    WTFormsHelpers(app)
    db.init_app(app); login_manager.init_app(app); csrf.init_app(app)
    # ... register blueprints ...
```

### Base template (`app/templates/base.html`)
The base template extends the upstream `govuk_frontend_jinja/template.html`
rather than rolling its own `<html>`/`<body>` chrome — this is what keeps us
in sync with the design system on upgrades:

```jinja
{% extends "govuk_frontend_jinja/template.html" %}

{% block pageTitle %}{% block title %}Grants platform{% endblock %} – GOV.UK{% endblock %}

{% block head %}
  <link rel="stylesheet" href="{{ url_for('static', filename='govuk-frontend.min.css') }}">
{% endblock %}

{% block header %}{% include "partials/header.html" %}{% endblock %}
{% block beforeContent %}{% include "partials/phase_banner.html" %}{% endblock %}
{% block footer %}{% endblock %}

{% block bodyEnd %}
  <script type="module" src="{{ url_for('static', filename='govuk-frontend.min.js') }}"></script>
  <script type="module">
    import { initAll } from "{{ url_for('static', filename='govuk-frontend.min.js') }}"
    initAll()
  </script>
{% endblock %}
```

### Static assets
Download `govuk-frontend.min.css` and `govuk-frontend.min.js` from the
[GOV.UK Frontend releases](https://github.com/alphagov/govuk-frontend/releases)
and place them in `app/static/`. The accompanying `assets/` folder
(`fonts/`, `images/`) sits alongside them under `app/static/assets/` and is
re-served at `/assets/<path>` by `app.public.govuk_assets` so the prebuilt
CSS resolves font and image URLs correctly.

---

## WTForms Usage Boundaries

WTForms is used **only** for forms with static, known-at-build-time fields:
- Login / registration
- Assessor scoring (always the same shape: score + notes per criterion)

**Do not use WTForms for application form sections.** Those fields are defined
in the JSON schema and rendered by `forms_runner.py` via GOV.UK Jinja macros
directly. This keeps the door open for a no-code form builder later without
requiring structural changes.

---

## Seed Data (for hackathon)

Populate `grants` and `forms` via a `seed.py` script using EHCF as the first
grant. This proves out the data-driven approach without needing an admin UI on
day one. See `refs/ehcf-prospectus.md` for the source data.

## Environment

```
FLASK_SECRET_KEY=
DATABASE_URL=sqlite:///grants.db      # or the Flask config equivalent
UPLOAD_FOLDER=uploads/
```

## Working patterns for Claude (binding conventions)

These are the **generic patterns every AI contribution must follow** so that
code produced across the four parallel streams looks like one codebase.
Deviations should be flagged up and agreed with the team, not slipped in.

### 1. MVP mindset

- **Smallest runnable slice wins.** If in doubt, hardcode a value, stub a
  branch, or fake a return — get the slice green, then iterate.
- **No speculative generality.** Don't add config knobs, plugin hooks, or
  abstract base classes "for later". The second grant in Phase 4 will teach
  us what's actually shared.
- **No polish passes on unfinished phases.** Formatting a file Claude didn't
  touch this task is out of scope; fixing unrelated bugs is out of scope.
- **When unsure, propose then build.** For anything beyond a one-file change,
  sketch the plan in one paragraph, get a nod, then code.

### 2. File & directory conventions

- **Python files:** `snake_case.py`. Blueprints live at `app/<name>.py`
  (`auth.py`, `applicant.py`, `assessor.py`, `forms_runner.py`, `scoring.py`).
- **Templates:** `app/templates/<blueprint>/<action>.html`
  (e.g. `applicant/dashboard.html`, `assessor/score.html`). Shared chrome in
  `app/templates/partials/`. Always extend `base.html`.
- **Static assets:** `app/static/`. The two GOV.UK bundle files
  (`govuk-frontend.min.css`, `govuk-frontend.min.js`) keep their upstream
  names and sit at the top level; the upstream `assets/` folder
  (fonts + images) sits beside them and is re-served at `/assets/<path>`
  by `app.public.govuk_assets` so the CSS resolves font/image URLs.
- **JSON form schemas:** `app/forms/<grant-slug>-<kind>-v<n>.json`
  (e.g. `ehcf-application-v1.json`, `ehcf-assessment-v1.json`). Lowercase,
  hyphen-separated, versioned from day one.
- **Grant config:** `seed/grants/<grant-slug>.json`. Same slug everywhere.
- **Tests:** `tests/test_<module>.py`, one per module under test. Shared
  fixtures in `tests/conftest.py`.
- **Ideas and decisions:** drop into `ideas/` using the timestamp prefix
  from `ideas/README.md`. Don't edit someone else's idea file — write a new
  one that references it.

### 3. Python code style

- **Python 3.12+**, type hints on all new function signatures and public
  attributes. Internal locals don't need annotations unless non-obvious.
- **Formatting:** 4-space indent, PEP 8, double-quoted strings. Keep lines
  under ~100 chars; wrap long expressions with parentheses, not backslashes.
- **Imports:** stdlib → third-party → local, blank line between groups. No
  wildcard imports.
- **Docstrings:** only for modules and for functions whose behaviour isn't
  obvious from the name + types. One-line triple-quoted is fine; full
  Google/Numpy style is overkill today.
- **No comments restating the code.** Comment the *why* when a choice is
  non-obvious (e.g. "weight applied as percentage of max, not raw score").
- **Errors:** raise specific exceptions at boundaries (input validation,
  DB constraints). Don't wrap internal calls in try/except to mask bugs.
  Let Flask's error handling surface them in dev.
- **No I/O in pure helpers.** `scoring.py`, validators, and schema walkers
  stay pure — they take data in, return data out. DB and filesystem access
  belong in blueprints or a thin persistence layer.

### 4. Flask patterns

- **App factory** (`create_app()`) in `app/__init__.py`. No module-level
  `app = Flask(__name__)`. Extensions initialised against the app inside
  the factory.
- **Blueprints per concern**, registered in the factory. URL prefixes:
  `/` (public), `/auth`, `/apply`, `/assess`. Never cross-import blueprint
  route functions — share via models or helper modules.
- **Route naming:** `snake_case` Python function names map to kebab-case
  URL paths (`def application_review` → `/apply/<id>/review`). `url_for`
  always; never hand-build a URL.
- **Session-based auth** via Flask-Login. Every non-public route is gated
  with `@login_required` and, where relevant, a role check decorator
  (`@applicant_required`, `@assessor_required`). Write the decorators
  once, in `app/auth.py`, reuse everywhere.
- **CSRF on every POST.** Flask-WTF for login/register/scoring forms gives
  this for free. For JSON-driven applicant pages, render a CSRF token
  into the page and validate it in `forms_runner.py`.

### 5. Data patterns

- **One place for grant-specific truth:** `grants.config_json`. Read it,
  don't duplicate it. If you find yourself about to copy a weight or a
  threshold into Python, rewrite the call site to read from config.
- **One place for form shape:** `forms.schema_json`. The form runner walks
  this; views never know what fields exist. Adding a field = editing JSON,
  not Python.
- **Status enums are centralised.** Define `ApplicationStatus` once in
  `models.py`; import it everywhere. Same for `AssessmentRecommendation`,
  `UserRole`. No stringly-typed status checks in views.
- **IDs are strings where they cross the JSON boundary** (criterion IDs,
  field IDs, page IDs). Numeric DB IDs stay inside SQLAlchemy.
- **Migrations:** defer Alembic until the schema settles; until then,
  destructive resets via `seed.py` are fine. Once Alembic is in, every
  model change ships with a migration in the same PR.

### 6. JSON schema & grant config contracts

These shapes are **cross-stream contracts** — if you change them, announce
it and update every consumer in the same commit.

- **Form schema:** `{id, version, pages: [{id, title, fields: [{id, type,
  label, required, ...}]}]}`. Field `type` is one of: `text`, `textarea`,
  `radio`, `checkbox`, `select`, `number`, `currency`, `date`, `file`. New
  field types need a runner handler *and* a macro.
- **Grant config:** `{slug, name, status, eligibility: [...], criteria:
  [{id, label, weight, max, auto_reject_on_zero}], award_ranges: {...},
  timeline: {...}}`. Weights sum to 100.
- **Answers payload:** `{page_id: {field_id: value}}`. Drafts and
  submissions use the same shape — `status` distinguishes them.
- **Scores payload:** `{criterion_id: int}` and notes `{criterion_id:
  str}`. Keys must match `criteria[].id` exactly.

### 7. Templates (GOV.UK)

- Always extend `base.html`. Put page-specific `<title>` in a `{% block
  title %}`; never inline a new `<html>` tag.
- Use GOV.UK macros for inputs, buttons, error summaries. Don't write raw
  `<input class="govuk-input">` — it drifts from the design system on
  upgrade.
- Error summary at the top of any form page on validation failure; the
  runner provides one, reuse it.
- No inline CSS or JS. If styling is needed beyond GOV.UK defaults, add
  to a single `app/static/app.css`.

### 8. Tests

- Every merged phase slice ships with at least **one smoke test** exercising
  the happy path end-to-end. Failure cases come later.
- Use `pytest` + Flask's `test_client`. Fixtures for `app`, `client`, a
  seeded applicant user, a seeded assessor user — all in `conftest.py`.
- Test data: reuse the EHCF seed; don't invent parallel fixtures unless
  a test specifically needs a shape EHCF doesn't have.
- Don't test framework code (that Flask routes work, that SQLAlchemy
  saves). Test *our* logic: scoring math, eligibility rules, form
  validation, status transitions.
- **Don't run the full test suite over-eagerly.** It's slow and burns time
  during development. Run only the tests relevant to what you just changed
  (`pytest tests/test_<module>.py` or `pytest -k <pattern>`) while iterating.
  Reserve a full `pytest` run for the pre-commit / pre-PR check described
  in section 11 — not after every edit, not as a "just to be safe" sweep,
  and not when only docs/config/JSON unrelated to test paths changed.

### 9. Commits, branches, PRs

- **Branch per stream/task**, short-lived, merged to `main` the same day.
  No long-running feature branches.
- **Commit messages:** imperative mood, under 72 chars, e.g.
  `add applicant dashboard skeleton`, `read scoring weights from grant
  config`. Body only if the *why* isn't obvious.
- **One logical change per commit.** If you did two things, make two
  commits.
- **PRs are small.** A PR that touches >10 files or >400 lines of
  non-generated code should be split unless it's seed/migration data.
- Never push to `main` directly; never force-push a shared branch.

### 10. When to stop and ask

Pause and ask the team / user before:

- Introducing a new dependency (anything not already in `pyproject.toml`).
- Changing a cross-stream contract (schema shape, grant config keys,
  status enum, DB column types).
- Deleting or renaming a file that another stream imports.
- Adding a feature that isn't in the current phase of `PLAN.md`.
- Shipping anything that makes `main` not boot or `pytest` not pass.

For anything else: decide, do, commit, move on.

### 11. What "done" looks like for a Claude task

Before reporting a task complete, Claude must:

1. Have the app boot (`flask --app wsgi run`) without import errors.
2. Have `pytest` pass (or state explicitly which tests were added/skipped
   and why).
3. Have touched only files within the task's stream (or have flagged the
   cross-stream edit and why it was necessary).
4. Have updated `PLAN.md` if a feature from the catalogue is now done,
   partially done, or consciously punted.
5. Have a commit message that names the phase/stream touched.

If any of those can't be satisfied, say so plainly — "I got X working but
Y is broken" is more useful than a green-tick summary that hides the gap.

The project has local Claude Code skills in `.claude/skills/` to accelerate
development. These are the available project-level skills:

| Skill | Invocation | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| **orchestrate** | `/orchestrate` | Scan PLAN.md for pending work, dispatch parallel sub-agents in isolated worktrees (one per stream), review results, and create PRs. Trigger repeatedly to advance the build. |
| **ship** | `/ship` | Run pre-flight checks (tests, lint, boot), create a branch, and open a PR to main. |
| **verify** | `/verify` | Quick health check — tests, lint, boot, git state. |
| **stream-a** | `/stream-a` | Context loader for Stream A (Auth + Applicant UX). |
| **stream-b** | `/stream-b` | Context loader for Stream B (Form Runner). |
| **stream-c** | `/stream-c` | Context loader for Stream C (Assessor + Scoring). |
| **stream-d** | `/stream-d` | Context loader for Stream D (Platform + Data). |

### Orchestrator workflow

The `/orchestrate` skill is the primary development accelerator:

1. It reads PLAN.md to find pending work in the earliest unfinished phase.
2. It selects 2–3 independent tasks from **different streams** (so agents
   don't edit the same files).
3. It dispatches sub-agents in **isolated worktrees** — each gets its own
   branch and can't conflict with the others.
4. It reviews results for quality, stream boundary compliance, and correctness.
5. It creates PRs (never pushes to main directly).
6. It updates PLAN.md, CHANGELOG.md, and session notes.

Trigger `/orchestrate` repeatedly to keep advancing the build. Each run picks
up where the last one left off.

### Project settings

`.claude/settings.json` pre-allows common commands (pytest, ruff, flask,
git operations, gh CLI) so the orchestrator and sub-agents can run without
manual permission prompts on every command.

## Known gotchas and UX patterns (from 2026-04-16 audit)

### Date fields in `govukDateInput` — extraction and pre-fill

**Trigger:** Any form page with a `date` field type.

`govukDateInput` with `namePrefix=fid` submits three separate POST params:
`fid-day`, `fid-month`, `fid-year`. The generic extractor pattern
`form_data.get(fid)` returns `None`. The fix is in `_extract_field_values`
(`app/applicant.py`) with an explicit `elif ftype == "date":` branch that
reads the three sub-fields and assembles `YYYY-MM-DD`. The template must also
split that stored value back into three items when pre-filling:
```jinja
{% set _dp = field_value.split("-") if (field_value and "-" in field_value) else [] %}
{% set _day   = (_dp[2] | int | string) if _dp | length == 3 and _dp[2] else "" %}
{% set _month = (_dp[1] | int | string) if _dp | length == 3 and _dp[1] else "" %}
{% set _year  = _dp[0] if _dp | length == 3 and _dp[0] else "" %}
```
**Verify:** Save a date answer, navigate away, navigate back — values should be pre-filled.

### Header sign-out requires a POST form (logout is POST-only)

The `govukServiceNavigation` macro renders nav items as `<a>` tags (GET links).
The `/auth/logout` route is POST-only for CSRF protection. The "Sign out" item
in the header nav is therefore a broken GET link. The working sign-out is the
`<form method="post">` button on the applicant dashboard.

**Options if fixing:** (a) Accept GET on logout (simplest, low security risk),
(b) Add a hidden form + JS click handler to intercept the nav link.

### `govuk-!-background-colour-red` is not a valid GOV.UK utility class

This class was used in `assessor/allocation.html` to highlight over-budget
table rows. It does not exist in the vendored GOV.UK Frontend CSS. Use a
custom class in `app/static/app.css` instead:
```css
.app-row--over-budget { background-color: #f3d3c9; }
```

### `partials/header.html` — unauthenticated nav was empty

Before 2026-04-16, `_nav_items = []` for anonymous users. Now set to Sign in
+ Create account. Any future template work that needs unauthenticated nav
items should update `header.html` line ~39 in the `{% else %}` block.

### Landing page — dev content removed

The `public/index.html` previously showed `Slug: <code>{{ grant.slug }}</code>`
(debug info) and a dev-facing empty state ("Run python seed.py..."). Both have
been removed. Empty state now reads "There are no grants open for applications
at the moment. Check back soon."

### `app/static/app.css` — custom utility classes

Custom CSS that extends GOV.UK Frontend goes in `app/static/app.css` (Stream D
owns it). Name classes with `app-` prefix to avoid collisions with `govuk-` classes.

### Build status (2026-04-16 end of day)

**Phases 0-4 complete.** All PLAN.md build items either merged or in PR #60.
235 tests passing, 8 pre-existing failures (`test_assessor_ai.py` — missing
`anthropic` SDK). The data-driven architecture proved out: adding Common Ground
Award (P4.1) and Local Digital partnership schema (P4.4) required zero Python
code changes.

### Parallel orchestrator contention

Two `/orchestrate` sessions running concurrently will dispatch overlapping work.
The `.claude/orchestrator-claims.json` file was added to prevent this, but may
not be active in all sessions. Always check open PRs (`gh pr list`) before
creating new ones for the same tasks.
