# Grants Platform

A prototype grants application and assessment system. First grant onboarded: the
[Ending Homelessness in Communities Fund (EHCF)](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/ending-homelessness-in-communities-fund-prospectus)
administered by MHCLG.

The goal is a flexible core — so a second or third grant can be added without a rewrite —
but we're building the first grant end-to-end before generalising.

## The problem we're solving

Applying for a grant is hard. Applicants — often small voluntary or community organisations with limited capacity — must interpret dense policy documents, understand complex eligibility rules, and translate their work into the specific language assessors want to see. The result is that good projects get rejected because the application wasn't written well, not because the work wasn't fundable.

On the other side, assessors face the inverse burden: reading through large volumes of inconsistent, free-text applications, manually cross-referencing answers against criteria, and reconciling data spread across documents to reach a funding decision. This is slow, cognitively draining, and introduces inconsistency.

We're building a platform that uses AI to reduce both burdens. For applicants, the system provides guided, structured input — helping them express what they actually do in a way that maps cleanly to the assessment criteria. For assessors, it aggregates application data into a clear, comparable view and uses AI-assisted scoring to surface signal from noise — so staff spend their time on judgement, not data wrangling.

## Quick start

You need **one** of these installed:

- **[uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/)** (recommended — manages Python + deps for you), or
- **Docker + Docker Compose**.

Pick whichever you have. Both start from a clean clone; no other setup needed.

### Option A — uv (fastest inner loop)

```bash
# One-time: install uv (if you don't have it)
curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh

# Install deps (uv creates .venv and installs the locked versions)
uv sync

# Load EHCF grant + form into SQLite
uv run python seed.py

# Start the dev server on http://127.0.0.1:5000
uv run flask --app wsgi run --debug

# Run the tests
uv run pytest
```

That's it. `uv sync` is idempotent — re-running it after a `git pull` brings
your env back in sync with `uv.lock`.

### Option B — Docker Compose (one command, zero host deps)

```bash
# Build and start (prod-ish: gunicorn on :8000, data persisted in a Docker volume)
docker compose up --build

# Dev profile: Flask dev server with live reload on :5000, source bind-mounted
docker compose --profile dev up --build

# Tear down (keeps the volume)
docker compose down

# Nuke everything including the seeded DB and uploads
docker compose down -v
```

The container seeds the DB on first boot. Hit <http://127.0.0.1:8000/> (prod)
or <http://127.0.0.1:5000/> (dev).

### Common dev tasks

| Task | Command |
|---|---|
| Install / update deps | `uv sync` |
| Add a new dep | `uv add <package>` |
| Add a dev-only dep | `uv add --group dev <package>` |
| Run tests | `uv run pytest` |
| Run a single test | `uv run pytest tests/test_scoring.py -k weighted` |
| Lint | `uv run ruff check .` |
| Auto-fix lint | `uv run ruff check . --fix` |
| Reset the DB | `rm grants.db && uv run python seed.py` |
| Reset inside Docker | `docker compose run --rm web python seed.py --reset` |
| Shell inside the container | `docker compose run --rm web sh` |
| Health check | `curl http://127.0.0.1:8000/healthz` |

### Environment variables

Defaults work out of the box for local dev. Override via `.env` (gitignored) or
inline before the command.

| Variable | Default | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `FLASK_SECRET_KEY` | `dev-secret-change-me` | **Must** be overridden for anything shared. |
| `DATABASE_URL` | `sqlite:///grants.db` | Change to Postgres URL if we outgrow SQLite. |
| `UPLOAD_FOLDER` | `./uploads/` | Where applicant docs land. |

## Working in parallel

Four people, one day. **Read [`CONTRIBUTING.md`](CONTRIBUTING.md) before you
start** — it lists which files each stream owns and the pinned cross-stream
contracts. The short version:

- **Stream A (Auth + applicant UX)** → `app/auth.py`, `app/applicant.py`
- **Stream B (Form runner)** → `app/forms_runner.py`, `app/forms/*.json`
- **Stream C (Assessor + scoring)** → `app/assessor.py`, `app/scoring.py`
- **Stream D (Platform + data)** → `app/models.py`, `seed.py`, `config.py`,
  Docker, static assets

If another stream hasn't shipped the symbol you need, import the stub — it'll
raise `501` or `NotImplementedError` at runtime but your tests still run.

## Ground rules

- **Iterative** — thin vertical slice first, then expand. Every commit leaves
  `main` runnable (`uv run flask --app wsgi run` boots, `uv run pytest` passes).
- **Modular** — stay inside your stream's files. Cross-stream contracts
  (schema shapes, status enums, URL prefixes) are pinned in Phase 0 and only
  change with team agreement.
- **Innovative** — the differentiator is the **JSON-defined, grant-agnostic**
  core. Anything that hardcodes EHCF shapes into Python is a regression.
- **MVP, not V1** — if a feature is only needed for the second grant, defer
  it. Working end-to-end beats any single feature done beautifully.

If a change can't demo by the end of your loop, it's too big — carve a
smaller slice.

## JSON forms

Non-developers can design forms without touching Python. A form is a JSON
file; the Flask app (`app/forms_runner.py`) is a generic runner over it.

```json
{
  "id": "ehcf-application",
  "version": 1,
  "pages": [
    {
      "id": "organisation",
      "title": "About your organisation",
      "fields": [
        {"id": "name", "type": "text", "label": "Organisation name", "required": true},
        {"id": "org_type", "type": "radio", "label": "Organisation type",
         "options": [{"value": "charity", "label": "Registered charity"}], "required": true}
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

Supported field types are frozen: `text`, `textarea`, `radio`, `checkbox`,
`select`, `number`, `currency`, `date`, `file`. Adding one is a Stream B
change (new runner handler + new Jinja macro).

## Stack

| Layer | Choice |
|---|---|
| Language | Python 3.12 (pinned via `.python-version`) |
| Package / env manager | [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/) |
| Web framework | Flask 3 |
| Database | SQLite (single file, zero-config; Postgres later if needed) |
| ORM | SQLAlchemy 2.0 via Flask-SQLAlchemy |
| Auth | Flask-Login + werkzeug password hashing |
| Forms | JSON schemas for applicant forms; WTForms for static forms (login, scoring) |
| Templates | Jinja2 + GOV.UK Frontend (vendored CSS/JS + jinja macros) |
| WSGI server | gunicorn (in Docker) |
| Container | Dockerfile using the official `ghcr.io/astral-sh/uv` binary pattern |
